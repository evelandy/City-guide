				<h2>Entertainment</h2>
				<p><strong>Space Center Houston: </strong>Recent guests raved about the most popular attraction, a 90-minute narrated tram tour that explores some of the most interesting aspects of the space center and grounds. Visitors say the facility is especially fun for children and families, and suggest booking the free timed tickets for the tram tour in advance as the center can get crowded. Patrons will get a look at some of the space center's most interesting aspects, including astronauts in training and Mission Control.</p>
				<p><strong>Minute Maid Park: </strong>Housing more than 40,000 seats, the park also features a replica of a 19th-century locomotive that runs along about 800 feet along the west side of the ballpark which lights up and makes sounds when an Astros players scores a home run. </p>
				<p><strong>The Galleria: </strong>Aside from the retail stores, the Galleria is home to more than 50 dining options. Recent visitors cautioned if you plan to do a lot of shopping, anticipate a lot of walking (and wear some comfy shoes). They also say there are plenty of upscale accommodation options within walking distance. </p>
